## üìñ Table of Contents

This project includes tools for running shell commands and Docker container operations. For detailed information, please refer to the following documentation:

- [Tools Documentation](./docs/tools/tools.md)

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) Installed 
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Access to OpenAI API (for GPT-4o model) or Anthropic API (for Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

1. **Environment Variables:**

	Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key(s):

	```bash
	# Backend
	cd <project-root>/backend
	cp .example.env .env

	# Frontend
	cd <project-root>/frontend
	cp .example.env .env
	```

	Ensure that your `.env` file is not tracked by git by checking the `.gitignore`:

2. **Start Docker Services**

	Below will start the database, and the GUI for viewing the Postgres DB.

	```bash
	cd <project-root>
	docker compose up postgres pgadmin
	```

3. **Setup Server Environment**

	Assumes you're using [astral uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). See `./backend/scripts` directory for other dev utilities.

	```bash
	# Change directory
	cd <project-root>/backend

	# Generate virtualenv
	uv venv

	# Activate
	source .venv/bin/activate

	# Install
	uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt

	# Run
	bash scripts/dev.sh # Select "no" when prompted.
	```

4. **Setup Client Environment**

	```bash
	# Change Directory
	cd <project-root>/frontend

	# Install
	npm install

	# Run
	npm run dev
	```

## Database Migrations

This project uses Alembic for database migrations. Here's how to work with migrations:

### Initial Setup

1. Create the database (if not exists):

	```bash
	cd backend
	alembic upgrade head
	```

	```bash
	python -m seeds.user_seeder
	```

2. Create new

	```bash
	alembic revision -m "description_of_changes"
	```

	```bash
	### Appliy Next
	alembic upgrade +1

	### Speicif revision
	alembic upgrade <revis_id>

	### Appliy Down
	alembic downgrade -1

	### Appliy Down
	alembic downgrade <revis_id>

	### History
	alembic history
	```
