## 2026.8.7

### Fixed
  - fix/966-toast-audit — audit the ~101 toast call sites that #965 made live in one change, and stop the four that storm. Highest severity was `hooks/useChat.ts`: `toast.error("MCP sandbox unreachable", { duration: Infinity })` fired per SSE payload with no id and no guard, so three of them permanently occupied every slot under `visibleToasts={3}` and starved the notification surface app-wide — a real outage could silence the very surface you need during the debugging session. It is no longer a toast at all. An unreachable sandbox is a terminal failure of a run the transcript is visibly waiting on, which is exactly what the existing `RunErrorBanner` was built for (the `streamMode === "error"` branch 15 lines above already routes there), and a `setRunError` state write is idempotent by construction — N events collapse to one banner with no id bookkeeping to get wrong later. **Found while implementing it:** the branch was near-unreachable in the first place. The backend emits `mcp_sandbox_unreachable` (`agents/__init__.py:353`) but `convertEventToLegacy` had no case for it and both `parseEvent` switches in `lib/utils/fetchStreamReader.ts` fell through to `default: return null`, so on the unified stream path the event was silently dropped and the run just stopped with no explanation — a worse bug than the one reported. The event is now typed in `lib/entities/stream.ts` and wired through both readers and the legacy converter, so the banner is genuinely reachable. `RunError` gains an optional `title`, `ChatMessages` imports that type instead of redeclaring its own copy, and the DLQ Replay button — which rendered unconditionally while `recoverable` was declared and never read — is now gated on `recoverable !== false && runId`, because replaying a run that never reached the DLQ dead-ends. Related: `metadata` is captured by closure at `startManagedStream` render time while `run_id` arrives in a later event, so both error branches now read a `metadataRef` and the banner's correlation id is actually populated.
  - fix/966-toast-audit — stop the remaining three storms. `hooks/useChat.ts:319`: a recoveryMode `error` event toasted per event and returned without closing the source; it now aborts the controller, closes the stream, and notifies once per stream behind a closure latch and a stable id — per-stream rather than global, so a genuinely new stream still gets its own notification. The `stream.onError` sibling shares that latch and id; the 404/409 informational toast deliberately does not, since sonner merges by id and would have overwritten the error text with a reassurance. `hooks/useMessageQueue.ts`: the drop-after-max-retries toast reschedules itself every 100ms, so one outage emitted ~30 toasts; drops inside a 5s window now accumulate into one toast under a fixed id ("3 messages dropped after max retries"), and the per-retry warning keeps its copy under a second, deliberately distinct id — "still trying" and "gave up" are different states and must not clobber each other. The per-message query preview is dropped from the plural case, where it can only describe one of N. `pages/memories/edit.tsx` — not in the issue, same class, cheap — was a mount effect that toasted *and* navigated with no id and no guard, giving two of each under `<StrictMode>`; it now has both a ref guard and a stable id.
  - fix/966-toast-audit — fix the retry loop underneath the `context/ChatContext.tsx` save toast. `lastSavedPersistentSignatureRef` was only advanced inside the `try`, so after a failed PATCH the signature stayed dirty and every subsequent keystroke re-fired a failing request and an identical toast, roughly one per 500ms idle window with the backend down. Advancing the ref in the `catch` is the tempting one-liner and is a data-loss bug — that ref is also the dirty indicator and the autosave-skip guard, so advancing it marks unsaved text as saved. Instead, autosave failures now back off exponentially (2s doubling to a 30s cap) and re-arm a real retry at the deadline, because the only other autosave trigger is a signature change: a user who types, sees the failure, and stops typing would otherwise be stranded with unsaved content and no pending timer, and `hasUnsavedPersistentChanges` has no UI consumer to tell them. Manual saves bypass the backoff entirely, so the Save button is always a live escape hatch, and their toast carries no dedupe id — deduping a click response would violate the surrounding policy. The issue's alternative (follow `useScheduleExecutions.ts:40` and decline to toast at all) was rejected: unsaved user text is at stake, so this earns exactly one toast.
  - fix/966-toast-audit — apply one policy, "the hook owns the toast", across the schedules stack, replacing eight double-toast pairs where the hook toasted and rethrew and the component caught and toasted again ("Schedule created successfully" and "Schedule created successfully!" both fired). `pages/schedules/index.tsx`'s delete handler was already correct and is the pattern the other twelve call sites now match. The `try/catch` blocks and their `console.error` stay — `deleteSchedule` rethrows, so removing them would trade a duplicate toast for an unhandled rejection — and the page's bare `await deleteSchedule(...)` gains the catch it was missing. Two related defects surfaced while applying it. `useAgentSchedules.createSchedule`/`updateSchedule` early-returned on a falsy `agentId` before any toast and before any API call, so the panel was reporting success for a write that never happened; they now report the error and throw, which also keeps the dialog open. And a create whose refresh failed emitted 2 success + 1 error simultaneously, leaving the user staring at "created successfully" beside "failed to load" and a list without their new schedule — the rational read is that it failed, and the retry creates a duplicate; post-write refreshes are now silent, so the write reports its own outcome once. Load-failure toasts get stable ids (they fire from mount effects, and there are two live `useSchedules` consumers — the page and the sidebar panel — so an outage stacked one toast each, doubled again under StrictMode); create/update/delete deliberately get none, since they answer a click and must fire every time.
  - fix/958-store-health-reentry — stop `GET /api/info/health/store` from entering the application-wide store as an async context manager. `get_store` returns `req.app.state.store`, the single `AsyncPostgresStore` created once in the lifespan, so the handler's `async with store as s:` ran `__aenter__`/`__aexit__` on a singleton whose lifecycle it does not own — a diagnostic endpoint manipulating the resource it measures. The handler now awaits `store.asearch(...)` on the injected instance directly, inside the same 5s `asyncio.timeout`; the response body, the timeout→503 branch, and the `"connection"`/`"closed"`→503 mapping are all unchanged. Correcting the issue as filed: this was **latent, not an active outage**. On the pinned `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` 3.1.0, `AsyncPostgresStore.__aenter__` is a bare `return self` and `__aexit__` only stops a TTL sweeper task that is never started (the store-level `ttl=` is never configured, so `_ttl_sweeper_task` is always `None`); the pool is closed solely by `from_conn_string`'s own `async with`, which unwinds at lifespan exit. The reported pool exhaustion therefore does not reproduce today — but a future `ttl=` config, or a langgraph version whose `__aexit__` releases resources, would have degraded the process-wide store silently. The endpoint had **zero tests**, which is how the pattern survived; `backend/tests/integration/test_health_store.py` adds five, covering the happy path, both 503 branches, the 500 fallback, and — the one that pins the fix — a store double that is a perfectly valid context manager and simply *counts* entries, so the pre-fix handler fails on `aenter_calls == 1` rather than on an incidental error. All five fail against the pre-fix handler. Scoped deliberately to the health probe: `services/assistant.py:227,294` and `services/prompt/__init__.py:168` re-enter the same singleton and are left for a follow-up.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — stop a backend outage from rendering as a silently vanishing model picker. Two independent defects combined to produce it. First, the app could not display an error at all: `sonner` was a dependency and `components/ui/sonner.tsx` exported a `Toaster`, but that component was imported nowhere, so all 101 non-test `toast.*` calls across 25 files were no-ops (the issue says 66; the real count is 101). `<Toaster />` is now mounted once in `main.tsx` under `ThemeProvider`, at `top-center` — every bottom position collides with the bottom-anchored composer, the split-view panel, `AgentMenu`'s mobile sheet, or the query devtools, and below ~600px sonner goes full-width and blankets the composer entirely. Second, `useModel` destructured only `data` and defaulted it to an empty payload, so `ChatInput`'s `{displayModel && ...}` gate collapsed error, empty, and still-loading into one output: nothing. The picker is extracted into `components/inputs/ModelPicker.tsx` and now renders five distinct states — nothing when unauthenticated, a skeleton while loading, an **enabled** retry chip on error (a disabled control would say "not for you" rather than "not right now"), a static `No models available` chip on a zero-model success, and the normal picker otherwise — all at a uniform 24px height so the action row does not reflow. The composer stays fully usable during an outage: `displayModel` is display-only and the server resolves the default, so the textarea and submit button are never disabled.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — make `ui/sonner.tsx` read the app's own theme. It imported `useTheme` from `next-themes`, but no `NextThemesProvider` is mounted anywhere, so `theme` was always `undefined` and fell back to `"system"` — a user on the default dark UI with a light OS got white toasts. It now reads `ThemeProviderContext` via `@/hooks/useTheme` and maps the app's four-value `Theme` union onto sonner's three, with `"gray"` mapped to `"dark"` (verified against `.gray`'s `--background: 220 15% 35%`, not inferred from the name). Measured in-browser: the toast background now matches the app background exactly in light, gray, and dark. `next-themes` is left in `package.json` for a follow-up.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — guarantee one toast per outage instead of a stack. New `lib/utils/connectionToast.ts` exposes `notifyConnectionLost`/`notifyConnectionRestored` behind a single fixed sonner id, so N concurrent failures replace in place rather than stacking, and recovery replaces the error rather than sitting contradictorily beside it. It fires from one effect in `useModel`, ref-guarded on the `false → true` transition of `isError` so `<StrictMode>`'s double-invoked effects stay idempotent, and never when unauthenticated. The six mount-time and edit-load failure paths in `useSchedules`, `useAgentSchedules`, `MemorySettings`, `memories/edit`, `schedules/index`, and `AgentSchedulesPanel` route through the same helper *only* when the error carries no HTTP response; anything the server actually answered keeps its specific message, and every user-initiated toast is untouched. Verified in-browser: `/schedules` and `/memories` each show exactly one toast with both their own endpoint and `/llm/models` failing.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — set `retry: 0` on the models query. `apiClient` already retries once and the global `queryClient` retried again on top, compounding to roughly 40s before `isError` ever flipped — far past the point a user has given up. The global default is unchanged; `retry` resolves per *query* rather than per observer in TanStack Query v5, so `useModelsList`, which shares the `["models"]` key, carries the same override or it would restore `retry: 1` whenever it initiated the fetch. `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `refetchOnReconnect` are enabled on this query so recovery is hands-free.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — fix two adjacent states that also rendered as nothing. Hiding every model in Settings now still renders the normal picker (user-caused and user-fixable, so it must not look like an outage) with `CommandEmpty` reading `All models are hidden. Turn some on in Settings → Model Visibility.`; a successful load with no default renders the picker labelled `Select model` rather than disappearing. Accessibility: the error chip carries a `WifiOff` icon and distinct text so it never relies on color alone, the picker trigger gains an `aria-label` carrying the current model (its only accessible name was `title="Change default model"`), and a polite live region announces the outage while rendering empty — rather than unmounting — when healthy. The chip's label uses `text-foreground` rather than the run-error `text-destructive`: measured on the composer, the inherited triple scores 1.93:1 (dark), 3.30:1 (light) and 1.08:1 (gray) at 12px, all failing WCAG 4.5:1, while `text-foreground` measures 18.5 / 17.5 / 6.1.
  - fix/960-toast-and-model-picker — add the missing coverage. `ChatInput.tsx` had no tests at all (`ChatComposer.test.tsx` stubbed it out entirely); it now has 13 covering every picker state, keyboard reachability of the retry control, and submission during an outage. `useModel.test.ts` gains its first failure cases, pinning that the toast fires exactly once across re-renders and not at all when unauthenticated, and `ui/sonner.tsx` gains a suite asserting the theme mapping for all four values.

## 2026.8.6

### Changed
  - task/948-consolidate-docs — retire the `wiki` git submodule and consolidate documentation into a plain `docs/` folder. The submodule was never initialized by CI, so every clone left an empty `wiki/` directory that tooling flagged as missing. Vendors the documentation markdown (27 pages) and the 49 screenshots it references into `docs/`, rewriting root-absolute `/img/...` links to page-relative paths so they render on GitHub. Drops the `docs/` entry from `.gitignore` (added by `de842557` in March, when `docs/` was a stale duplicate of `decks/`) so the path can serve as the documentation home. Updates the dangling `README.md` link, the `AGENTS.md` component list, and both issue templates, and adds `docs/**` to `test.yml`'s `paths-ignore` so documentation edits no longer trigger the backend and frontend suites, plus a `workflow_dispatch` trigger so the suite can be re-run manually. Also gates `test-e2e` behind that manual trigger (`if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'`): at ~8m50s it was the workflow's entire critical path against ~2m for `test-backend` and `test-frontend` combined, while already carrying `continue-on-error: true` — so it cost wall-clock on every push without gating anything. Run it from the Actions tab when a change warrants full-stack coverage. The Docusaurus app stays in `mifunedev/wiki`, so the docs.ruska.ai deploy is unchanged.
  - task/950-config-env-path — move the environment file location from `~/.env/orchestra/` to `~/.config/orchestra/`. The primary backend env is now `~/.config/orchestra/.env` (was `.env.backend`); the test and frontend envs move to the same directory but keep distinct names (`.env.test`, `.env.frontend`) so `make test` and the pre-commit hook keep running against the test database rather than the development one. Updates `backend/Makefile`, `frontend/package.json`, `infra/docker-compose.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `backend/.vscode/launch.json`, the four `evals/probes/resiliency-*.sh`, the example notebooks, and the agent docs. Existing checkouts need `mkdir -p ~/.config/orchestra` and to move their env files across.

### Fixed
  - task/955-db-pool-exhaustion — stop the SQLAlchemy connection pool from exhausting and returning 500 for every authenticated request. `verify_credentials` and the two `get_optional_user*` wrappers took the session as a FastAPI dependency, and dependency teardown runs *after* the path operation function returns — so one pooled connection stayed checked out for the whole request, which for `/llm/invoke` is an entire agent turn and for the SSE path the whole stream. Auth now opens its own short-lived session around the user lookup only. The engine was also created with no pool arguments at all, silently running on SQLAlchemy's defaults (size 5, overflow 10, timeout 30s); it is now configured explicitly via `DB_SQLA_POOL_SIZE`/`DB_SQLA_POOL_MAX_OVERFLOW`/`DB_SQLA_POOL_TIMEOUT`/`DB_SQLA_POOL_RECYCLE` with `pool_pre_ping`. `pool_timeout` drops to 5s deliberately: queueing silently for 30s is what turned one burst into a cascade of 500s. Symptom was an empty model picker — `GET /llm/models` 500s for a signed-in user while the same endpoint returns 200 unauthenticated, because the anonymous path never touches the pool.
  - task/953-consolidate-api-deps — fold the optional `api` extra into the backend's default dependencies so a plain `uv sync` produces a runnable API. `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `slowapi`, `fastapi-cache2`, `fastmcp`, and `python-multipart` move from `[project.optional-dependencies]` into `[project] dependencies`, and `--extra api` is dropped from all six call sites that passed it (`test.yml` x2, `build.yml`, `backend.Dockerfile`, and both `docker-compose.yml` services). This repairs `.github/actions/backend-install.yml` and `.github/workflows/deploy-vm.yml`, which ran `uv sync --frozen --no-cache --no-dev` without the extra and so started `python main.py` against an install with no web framework in it. No documentation changed — plain `uv sync` is what `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `backend/README.md`, and `backend/CLAUDE.md` already documented. Trade-off: `infra/backend.Dockerfile`'s `worker-builder` stage deliberately installed without the extra and ran fine that way, so the worker image grows by the 35 packages the extra pulls in (+28 MB, 771 MB → 799 MB measured `--no-dev`).

  - task/961-reasoning-effort — stop OpenAI reasoning models 500ing on every chat. `openai:gpt-5.6-luna`, the default model, returned `400 Function tools with reasoning_effort are not supported for gpt-5.6-luna in /v1/chat/completions` for every request: `init_graph` passed no reasoning configuration, so `ChatOpenAI` used Chat Completions, and every Orchestra agent binds function tools (deepagents ships todo/filesystem tools). OpenAI reasoning models now route through the Responses API, the only transport that accepts function tools alongside reasoning — forcing `reasoning_effort="none"` instead would have kept the old transport by disabling reasoning on the very models chosen for it. Applied in `init_graph`, so every construction path (sync invoke, SSE stream, distributed worker, scheduled runs) is covered. Non-reasoning models, Anthropic, Gemini, and Bedrock are untouched; `ChatBedrockConverse` sets `extra="forbid"`, so it is excluded by construction.

### Added
  - task/955-db-pool-exhaustion — `GET /api/info/health/db` reports SQLAlchemy pool size, checked-in/checked-out counts, overflow, and configured limits. Pure introspection of the pool object, so it still answers while the pool is exhausted.
  - task/961-reasoning-effort — first-class reasoning-effort support. `POST /llm/invoke` and `POST /llm/stream` accept `reasoning_effort`; `PATCH /settings/default` accepts it as a saved default (request value wins); `GET /llm/models` gains a `reasoning` map of the effort values each model accepts plus `default_reasoning_effort`. Accepted values are read from the models.dev catalogue that already backs the model list rather than hard-coded, because they differ per model (`o3` stops at `high`, `gpt-5.6-luna` reaches `xhigh`/`max`, `gpt-5.2-chat-latest` takes only `medium`). An unsupported effort named explicitly in a request is a `422`; a *saved* default a later model does not accept is dropped rather than rejected, so switching models never breaks existing chats. Efforts are sent only to providers whose LangChain class accepts one (OpenAI, xAI, Groq) — Anthropic and Gemini expose thinking *budgets* instead and are tracked separately. The chat input gains an effort picker beside the model badge, rendered only for models that publish effort values.

## 2026.6.15

### Changed
  - feat/mermaid-zoom-support — add zoom in/out/reset controls to rendered Mermaid diagrams in markdown and Mermaid file previews.

## 2026.6.14

### Fixed
  - fix/940-mermaid-navigation — preserve Mermaid diagram source before rendering so slide diagrams stay visible after navigating between nested slides.
  - task/938-mifune-slide-brand — align the GitHub Pages slide deck and one-page handout with Mifune branding, green-only accents, mifune.dev links, and support@mifune.dev contact details.
  - task/936-pages-workflow-source — deprecate the legacy GitHub Pages branch source in favor of the `slides.yml` GitHub Actions deployment and correct stale deck deployment documentation.

## 2026.6.13

### Changed
  - feat/infra-consolidation — consolidate all Docker/build artifacts into a single `infra/` directory (one `docker-compose.yml` + thin `docker-compose.test.yml`); move `backend/Dockerfile` to `infra/backend.Dockerfile`; drop the dev/storage/services/debug overlays and the `dozzle` service; update Makefile, CI (`build.yml`/`test.yml`), and docs.

### Fixed
  - fix/thread-delete-silent-failure — thread deletion no longer silently fails while returning `204`. `ServiceContext.delete_thread` now deletes the thread record first (the operation the thread list reads from) and treats checkpoint cleanup as best-effort, instead of deleting checkpoints first, aborting the whole delete on any checkpoint failure, and swallowing the exception (`return e`) so the route reported success regardless. Genuine failures now propagate (404/500) instead of a false `204`. Also implements `adelete_thread` on `ResilientAsyncPostgresSaver`, which previously inherited `BaseCheckpointSaver`'s `NotImplementedError` and made every thread delete fail when `CHECKPOINT_USE_RESILIENT=true`.
  - fix/onboarding-tour-persist-on-close — persist onboarding completion when the welcome tour is dismissed via the X button or overlay click (`ACTIONS.CLOSE`), so it no longer re-fires on every login. Previously only Skip/Done persisted; closing hid the tour for the session but left `onboarding_completed` unset.
  - fix/walkthrough-visibility-zindex — make the onboarding walkthrough's highlighted element clearly visible (darker overlay dim + a vivid spotlight ring) in both light and dark themes, and stop the Help/walkthrough button from overlaying the Files drawer by only elevating it above the tour overlay while the tour is running.
