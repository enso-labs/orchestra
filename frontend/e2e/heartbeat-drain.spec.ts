/**
 * Resiliency spec: Heartbeat / stream drain on worker loss
 *
 * Scenario:
 *   1. Start a streaming run (send a message that triggers a long response).
 *   2. Confirm the app itself wrote an active-stream recovery record to
 *      localStorage (`ruska.active_streams.v1`) with the REAL thread id, run id,
 *      and a live `lastEventId` cursor — this is the wiring that makes
 *      worker-loss recovery possible (useChat.ts → persistDistributedRecovery).
 *   3. Simulate worker loss mid-stream by aborting the real distributed stream
 *      endpoints, then reload the page.
 *   4. On reload, the chat must NOT be a silent dead UI. It must EITHER:
 *        - resume / restore the run from its persisted checkpoint (the
 *          assistant message bubble re-renders), OR
 *        - surface the "Lost connection… refresh to retry" recovery message.
 *      The active-stream record drives `useActiveStreamRecovery.ts`, which
 *      reattaches when the backend thread is still `stream_status: "running"`,
 *      and otherwise clears the stale record after the checkpoint loads.
 *
 * Worker-loss recovery is now implemented end-to-end: the stream lifecycle
 * persists/clears the recovery record (useChat.ts) and the reattach hook +
 * checkpoint reload guarantee a visible recovery signal on reload.
 *
 * GREEN signal: on regression (record not written, or reload yields a silent
 * UI) this test fails hard.
