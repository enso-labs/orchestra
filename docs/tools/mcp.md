:::info Actively Evolving
MCP integration is actively being enhanced with new features and capabilities. This documentation reflects the current implementation and is updated regularly.
:::

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Introduction

Ruska Labs MCP support is based on the [Langchain MCP Adapter](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters) repository. A sample MCP server can be found at [Ruska Labs - MCP SSE Server](https://github.com/ruska-ai/mcp-sse).

See this [permalink](https://github.com/ruska-ai/mcp-sse/blob/caa79bee4af4914d729ef1989156b66966121d80/main.py#L22-L27) for an example for how to include `x-mcp-key` authentication.

## Quick Start (UI)

### Step 1: Open the Manage Tools Modal

Click the **tool count button** (shows the number of active tools) next to the chat input, then select **Configure Tools** from the dropdown menu.

This opens the **Tool Selection** modal where you can manage all tool integrations across four categories:

- **Platform** — Built-in tools (search, sandbox, finance, memory, etc.)
- **API** — Custom API tools you create
- **MCP** — Model Context Protocol server integrations
- **A2A** — Agent-to-Agent protocol connections

### Step 2: Navigate to the MCP Tab

Click the **MCP** tab in the left sidebar to access the MCP server configuration panel.

If no servers are configured yet, you'll see an empty state prompting you to add one:

![MCP Empty State](../img/tools/02-mcp-empty-state.png)

### Step 3: Add an MCP Server

Click the **+ Add Server** button in the top-right corner to open the server configuration form.

![MCP Add Server Form](../img/tools/03-mcp-add-server-form.png)

The form includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Template** | Choose a preset (Custom, Ruska MCP, GitHub MCP) or configure manually |
| **Server Name** | A unique identifier for your server (e.g., `my_mcp_server`) |
| **Transport** | Protocol type: **SSE**, **Streamable HTTP**, or **STDIO** |
| **URL** | The MCP server endpoint URL |
| **Header Key** *(optional)* | Authentication header name (e.g., `x-api-key`) |
| **Header Value** | The corresponding header value / API key |

:::tip Templates
Use the **Template** dropdown to quickly configure common MCP servers. Selecting a template pre-fills the Server Name, Transport, and URL fields.

:::

### Step 4: Save and Fetch Tools

Fill in your server details and click **Add Server** to save the configuration:

![Filled Add Server Form](../img/tools/05-mcp-add-server-filled.png)

Once saved, the server appears in the **Configured Servers** list with its transport type and URL. Click **Fetch Tools** to connect and load the available tools from the server:

![MCP Server Added](../img/tools/06-mcp-server-added.png)

After fetching, the server's tools appear as selectable cards in the tool grid below. Click any tool card to enable or disable it — selected tools show a checkmark badge.

### Step 5: Use MCP Tools

Close the modal and start chatting. MCP tools you selected are now available to the AI agent. When the agent uses an MCP tool, you'll see tool execution messages in the thread between your message and the AI response. Click on a tool message to view its execution details.

:::info Configuration Persistence
Your MCP server configuration is saved to your user defaults on the backend, so it persists across sessions. You can manage your servers at any time by reopening the Manage Tools modal.
:::

:::warning Silent Failures
If an MCP server is unreachable or returns an error during tool discovery, the agent will proceed without those tools. No error is shown in the chat UI. Check the backend logs for `Error fetching MCP tools` if expected tools are missing from the agent's tool list.
:::

## How MCP Configuration Works

The `mcp` property accepts a **dictionary of server names** mapped to their configurations. This allows you to connect multiple MCP servers simultaneously:

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "server_name_1": {
            "transport": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp-server1.example.com",
            "headers": {
                "x-mcp-key": "your_key_1"
            }
        },
        "server_name_2": {
            "transport": "sse",
            "url": "https://mcp-server2.example.com",
            "headers": {
                "x-mcp-key": "your_key_2"
            },
            "enabled": false
        }
    }
}
```

Each key in the `mcp` dictionary is a unique server name you choose (e.g., `"weather_server"`, `"database_server"`, `"ruska_mcp"`).

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `transport` | string | Yes | Protocol type: `sse`, `streamable_http`, or `stdio` |
| `url` | string | Yes | The MCP server endpoint URL |
| `headers` | object | No | HTTP headers for authentication (e.g., `{"x-api-key": "..."}`) |
| `enabled` | boolean | No | Toggle the server on/off without removing its config. Defaults to `true` |

Setting `"enabled": false` lets you temporarily disable an MCP server without deleting its configuration. Servers without the `enabled` field are enabled by default (backwards compatible).

### Supported Transports

| Transport | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SSE** | Server-Sent Events — the most common transport for remote MCP servers |
| **Streamable HTTP** | HTTP-based streaming transport |
| **STDIO** | Standard I/O — for locally running MCP servers |

### Granular Tool Selection

Once MCP servers are configured, you can selectively enable specific tools from those servers. In the UI, simply click tool cards to toggle them. Via the API, use the `tools` property:

```json
{
    "query": "Get the weather in Denver",
    "model": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "mcp": {
        "weather_server": {
            "transport": "sse",
            "url": "https://weather-mcp.example.com"
        },
        "database_server": {
            "transport": "sse",
            "url": "https://db-mcp.example.com"
        }
    },
    "tools": [
        "get_weather",
        "get_forecast",
        "query_database",
        "search"
    ]
}
```

**Benefits of Granular Tool Selection:**

-   **Load multiple MCP servers** at once without enabling all their tools
-   **Restrict assistants** to specific tools from those servers for better security
-   **Mix MCP tools** with built-in platform tools like `search`
-   **Better performance** through selective tool access — fewer tools means faster inference

**Example with Assistants:**

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://chat.ruska.ai/api/assistant' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "Weather Assistant",
  "instructions": "You are a weather information assistant.",
  "model": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "mcp": {
    "weather_server": {
      "transport": "sse",
      "url": "https://weather-mcp.example.com"
    }
  },
  "tools": ["get_weather", "search"]
}'
```

This assistant has access to the `get_weather` tool from the MCP server and the built-in `search` tool, but NOT other tools the weather server might expose.
