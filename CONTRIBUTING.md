# Contributing to Orchestra

ðŸŽ‰ **Thanks for helping make Orchestra better!**  
We follow the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) &mdash; every commit
must be signed off with the `-s` flag (`git commit -s -m "message"`).

## Ground rules

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Code style | `pre-commit run --all-files` must pass. |
| Commit sign-off | Adds `Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>` automatically. |
| Pull requests | Target `main`, follow PR template, link issues. |
| Tests | `make test` must be green; CI blocks otherwise. |
| Review SLA | Maintainers reply within **5 working days**. |
